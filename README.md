# Artist Portal

Auto Agent optimizes calendars for artists and venues to maximize potential profitability.


## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Seed the database with data

```
$ rails db:seed
```


Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```


If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
